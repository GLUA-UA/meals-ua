![example](https://i.imgur.com/nPc9E1c.png)

Migrated from [this repository](https://github.com/RodrigoRosmaninho/ementas-ua)
#### Requirements:

- Python 3
- Additional pip libraries installed automatically by [install.sh](https://github.com/GLUA-UA/meals-ua/blob/master/install.sh) or by running:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

By default, the script presents the menus of the current day at the 3 canteens located on the main campus.

You can, however, use additional arguments such as **-w** or **-l** to show menus for the whole week, or in a different location.

#### Usage:

After cloning this repository, navigate to its directory, and run:
```
sh ./install.sh
```
Which makes sure **xmltodict** is installed and creates the relevant aliases in **.bashrc** and **.zshrc**

Now you can use the script by running:

```
ementa
```
